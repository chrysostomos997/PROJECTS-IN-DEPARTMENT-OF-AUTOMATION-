# CNC Programming

CNC programming for lathe and mill machines involves writing code that controls the movements and operations of the machine. 
The programming language used for CNC machines is typically G-code, which is a standard set of instructions that the machine can understand.
For a lathe machine, the CNC program must specify the tool movements, including the direction and speed of rotation, as well as the depth and width of cuts. 
The program must also specify the location of the workpiece, the starting position of the tool, and any required tool changes.
Similarly, for a mill machine, the CNC program must specify the tool movements and cutting operations, including the location and orientation of the tool, the speed and direction of rotation, and the depth and width of cuts.
The program must also specify the location of the workpiece, the starting position of the tool, and any required tool changes.
Both lathe and mill CNC programs typically use a set of standard G-codes to specify tool movements and operations.
These codes include commands for tool movement, spindle speed, feed rate, coolant control, and other functions.
